# SunBEAM

This is a game developed with [CoolBasic](https://www.coolbasic.com/) during years 2006 - 2008. Latest source code development is from year 2010 (version 1.7), but I think I never got that development complete, so version 1.6 is the latest and greatest release so far. Speaking of releases...

Releases: can be found from [this other repository](https://github.com/Taitava/SunBEAM-releases), which contains executables.

To play this game, you need 1) a Windows computer, 2) understanding of Finnish language, because even though the name _SunBEAM_ is in English, the game itself is completely in Finnish.

And finally, to know what this game actually is about, see [SunBEAM.txt](https://github.com/Taitava/SunBEAM/blob/main/SunBEAM.txt) (in Finnish). You can also check out the game's [discussion topic on CoolBasic forums](https://www.coolbasic.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=11&p=64210) (in Finnish too).

## TODO

I'm not planning any actual development on the game, but a few things could be cleaned up in the current development state:
 - Remove everything about _online toplists_ . That feature did not exist in 1.6 (so it's never released), so nobody has used it, and also the toplist server is long gone for good.
 - Also get rid of the game's internal update downloader. Make the update window to display a message that new updates can be checked from GitHub (although well, probably no new updates will ever be released........)
 - Maybe get rid of SunBEAM.dat because it guards media files against modifications, but it's not really needed and it might annoy people if somebody would try to do some development (although I guess no-one will).
